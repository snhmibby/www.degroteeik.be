# De Grote Eik
This repo holds the (maybe?) **[new site](https://degroteeik.netlify.app)** for [de grote eik](http://www.degroteeik.be).
Anyone can help with site building, translations, editing or new content!!

## What has been done?
- Extracted text from our old site and turned it into beautiful [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).
- Slapped the Markdown into a [website generator](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
- Configured [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/degroteeik/overview) to build & host the site from github.
- Uploaded images + created a nice image gallery/viewer
- Very basic agenda

## How can I help??
Create a github account and send pull requests, or send updated documents by mail.
Please don't edit or save markdown files in Word.

### Simple tasks to do
- The old content is extremely verbose.
  It would be nice to edit it into something readable.
- We need translations of our (new?) content.
- Find and configure a more beautiful [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
