## Guidelines
The Frog Garden and the Grote Eik aims to be a happy and healthy community for people of all ages.
Keep this in mind when bringing food, drinks and other entertainment aids.

We will supply food, (non-alcoholic) drinks, a place to sleep (bring a tent) and an amazing time on donation.

Please read the [house rules](/documents/frog-garden-guidelines.pdf) of the frog garden

## Location
For info and the route description, please see the [contact page](/contact).
Park your car outside the forest, or even better, come on your own power.

## Camping & sleeping
There is a place for tents created in the Frog Garden, you can also camp at Johans or Jurjens place.
We can use a field near the Frog for campervans.

## Food
All day there will be something to snack on donation.
Saturday will be a dinner and Sunday will be a brunch by Pauline, our resident star chef.

# Help us make something beatiful!
At the moment we are busy organizing.

We are looking for people who want  to make music, host workshops, have a market stand, or just want to help co-create something amazing!
