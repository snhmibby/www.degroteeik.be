To be announced

## Guidelines
The Frog Garden and the Grote Eik aims to be a happy and healthy community for people of all ages.
Keep this in mind when bringing food, drinks and other entertainment aids.

We will supply food, (non-alcoholic) drinks, a place to sleep (bring a tent) and an amazing time on donation.

Please read the [house rules](/frog-garden) of the frog garden

## Location
For info and the route description, please see the [contact page](/contact).
Please park your car outside the forest, or even better, come on your own power.
