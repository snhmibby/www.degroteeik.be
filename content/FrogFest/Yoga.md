Yoga with Janneke
<!--more-->
Letâ€™s step out of the seriousness of life.
In this yoga session we foccus on having fun.
Playing with breath, sound and movement.
With the privilege to practice in nature, we can use the elements to
let go, to connect the body & mind and to open your heart.
Turn your body, your thoughts your world upside down.
Schoulder,head or handstand whatever is possible we can make it happen
with a smile :-)
Bring your own yoga mat, we have a few to share
