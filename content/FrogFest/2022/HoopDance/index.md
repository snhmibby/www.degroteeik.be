Hoop dance workshop.

<!--more-->

Sanna Circle is a certified hoop dance instructor and artist. Her goal is to
inspire as many people as possible to explore the wonderous world of hoop
dancing. Hoopdancing is a very creative way to expres yourself. You could
consider it a game, a form of art, but most of all this is an invitation to
connect with yourself! You don't need any experience to join this workshop,
just come, explore and have some fun!
