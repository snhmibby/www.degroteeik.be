With her ukulele, ektara and piano, Flow sings her heart out and shares the
sound experiences she gathered travelling out-there and within.

From Wallmapu to Rajasthan she brings us with her songs to a party, an instant,
a fight, a meditation, â€¦ With authenticity and sensitivity she gives her music
to celebrate and contemplate what exists
