During the drum circle we will sit together in a circle and play the sounds
which are arising in the moment.

Itâ€™s an invitation to connect deeper with yourself and each other through the
music. We will share our intentions and wishes and give them strength with our
sounds. There is no right or wrong, the only goal is to listen and connect and
make music in a safe space without judgement. This way there is space for some
real magic to arise.
